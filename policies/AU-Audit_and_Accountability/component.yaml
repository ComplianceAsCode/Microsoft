        'Customers do not have access to any physical system components
        in Azure datacenters; all physical resources are audited and managed
        by Microsoft Azure. This control is inherited from Azure.

        The security incident management team combines the analysis of audit
        records with physical security monitoring data as needed to aid in
        incident investigations. Any breaches or physical security incidents
        are reported through the incident reporting process described in IR-6
        by the physical security team. Information from such physical security
        incidents can then be compared to audit logging records by the
        Security Operations Center (SOC) to further identify and investigate
        suspicious behavior. Furthermore, when a physical incident is detected,
        the SOC will use the related physical monitoring data and correlate it
        with audit records to determine if there was any associated logical
        breach or suspicious behavior.'
