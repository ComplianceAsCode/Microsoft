        'Customers do not have local access to any system resources in Azure
        datacenters. All local access protection controls are implemented
        and managed by Microsoft Azure, and this control is inherited from
        Azure.

        Microsoft Azure does not permit local access unless physical access
        is required. Local access -- user access (or processes acting on
        behalf of users) to Azure Infrastructure via direct connection without
        the use of a network -- to every component within Azure environment
        is physical restricted. Organizational user administration is
        performed remotely unless a specific troubleshooting event occurs.
        Therefor, there is no local access unless physical access is
        required. Local Administrator access must only be used to troubleshoot
        issues in instances where the member server is experiencing network
        issues and domain authentication is not working. Azure implements
        multifactor authentication for local access via access control
        mechanisms required for physical access to the environment. Rooms
        within the Azure datacenters that contain all Azure Infrastructure
        systems within the system boundary are restricted through various
        physical security mechanisms, including the requirement for
        corporate smart card badging access and biometric devices. Both forms
        of authentication are required for physical access at the ingress point
        to Azure datacenter colocations.'
