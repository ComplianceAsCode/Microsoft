        Microsoft Azure establishes edge routers as the managed interface for
        each telecommunication service. Edge routers serve as the first layer
        of network devices into the Microsoft Azure environment. These devices
        are managed by the Microsoft Azure networking team within Microsoft
        Azure.'

        Microsoft Azure Networking establishes routing policies at teh edge
        to only allow the export of 8075 public blocks to Microsoft Azure
        Border Gateway (BGP) peers. Edge Access Control Lists (ACLs) are
        applied inbound from all peering interfaces. The policy explicitly
        filters non "edge protocols" (SQL, RPC, 445, 135-139) from entering
        the network from untrusted sources.'

        'Microsoft Azure manages network boundary devices, which are designed
        to fail securely. This control is inherited from Microsoft Azure.

        NOTE: Customers can implement additional Azure services (e.g. load
        balancer, application gateway) to support Azure boundary protection
        mechanisms already in place.

        Microsoft Azure deploys geographically separate and redundant Gateway
        servers. When a Gateway system fails, it fails securely and access
        is restricted to the environment. In order to establish a connection
        to the Azure environment, a user must establish a separate connection
        to an active Gateway server managed by Azure.

        Additionally, if Azure Infrastructure network devices (including
        edge routers, access routers, load balancers, aggregration switches,
        and TORS) fail, the affected circuit becomes disconnected, thereby
        failing securely. A failure of an Azure network device cannot lead to,
        or cause information external to the system to enter the device, nor
        can a failure permit unauthorized information release. The built in
        redundancy allows Azure assets to fail without influencing
        availability.'
