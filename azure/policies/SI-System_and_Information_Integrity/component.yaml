      'Microsoft Azure is responsible for all datacenter operational security.
      Microsoft Azure is responsible for an intrusion detection system
      identifying rogue wireless devices. This control can be inherited
      from Microsoft Azure.

      Microsoft Azure regularly scans for rogue wireless signals on at least
      a quarterly basis within the Microsot datacenters. Results are logged
      and documented by a security incident management team. Any rogue signals
      are investigated and removed. Microsoft Azure has implemented a solution
      to continuosly monitor and alarm on detection of rogue wireless signals.
      This system has been deployed to Microsoft Azure accreditation boudary
      Azure datacenters in a phased deployment. This system allows for wireless
      scan data to be monitored continuously by various monitoring tools.'
